# Mobile Applications for Windows

Design and implement a native mobile application for **Windows 8.1** or **Windows 10**. The application should be **touch-friendly** and should provide **actual functionality** which users can take advantage of. That is, the application must be of value to the end user of a tablet or smartphone, enabling them to consume/produce real content. **DO NOT make an application for imaginary or unrealistic tasks (unless you are creating a game).**
